A Texas Hold'em game for Android based devices, but with a little twist.

The server is meant to run on a tab/pad (ex: Samsung Galaxy Tab) laying on the middle of a  table, and act as the dealer and simulate a poker table.
The players then sits around the tab/pad and connects to the game with their smartphones (or other handheld Android devices). The server/dealer then handles all further game logic and deals two cards to each connected client/player, handle bets, blinds and so on.
